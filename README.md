# Silent Firebase Transaction Failure in Firebase

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase transactions where a missing `return` statement in the transaction callback function leads to silent failure. The transaction might appear to succeed, but the data remains unchanged.

## Bug Description

A transaction is initiated to update a counter in Firebase Realtime Database. However, due to a missing `return` statement, the transaction callback does not properly return the updated data, causing the transaction to fail silently.  This can be hard to debug because there are no apparent errors. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your Firebase project.
4. Run `node bug.js`. Observe that the counter does not update.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`. Observe that the counter updates correctly.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the transaction callback function explicitly returns the updated data. This ensures Firebase correctly handles the transaction and updates the data in the database.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.

This demonstrates the importance of carefully reviewing the return values in asynchronous operations, especially within transactions.
